The word qlbox means "quick-launch toolbox". It consists of mainly three things:
1. Scripts to launch tmux as a login-session persistent facility.
2. An info-rich PS1 prompt string and some Bash alias to make better 
  Linux command-line experience.

Installation of this qlbox tool consists of just one step: 

At the end of your ~/.bashrc, add one line:

    source <SOME-DIR-PREFIX>/bash-qlbox/bash.rc.qlbox

Requirements for your Linux env:

[1] tmux 1.3 or above
[2] Python 2.7

If requirements are not met, you will see error message:

    launch_tmux.py fail!

on starting bash.rc.qlbox. But don't panic, your normal system behavior
is not harmed. You can ignore that error and use your Linux as usual.
If later tmux and Python are installed, qlbox will work at next time
you login to your Linux Bash shell.
